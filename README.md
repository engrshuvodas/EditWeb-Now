<h2>🛠️ Edit Any Website Using Code</h2>
<p>You can make any website temporarily editable using the following JavaScript snippet. Just copy it, paste it into your browser's address bar, and hit enter:</p>

<pre>
<code>javascript:document.body.contentEditable='true'; document.designMode='on'; void 0;</code>
</pre>

<p><strong>💡 Tip:</strong> You must include <code>javascript:</code> at the beginning and run it directly in the browser's address bar. This does <em>not</em> make permanent changes—only temporary, local edits.</p>

<p><strong>⚠️ Note:</strong> Some browsers may block JavaScript in the address bar. In that case, create a bookmark and paste this code in the URL field to use it as a bookmarklet.</p>
